### Overall turking recipe
1. Create a Turk task 
2. Debug it on the MTurk sandbox
3. Figure out pricing to pay people reasonably
4. Lauch the task on "real" MTurk and find good workers

#### Sandbox and pricing
1. Create an MTurk sandbox [requester](https://requestersandbox.mturk.com/) and [worker](https://workersandbox.mturk.com/) accounts
2. Upload a small batch of hits (~10)
3. Do like 2 or 3 hits (and share the sandbox link with co-authors), see how long it takes for all of us on average  / median time.
4. Using those times, find a price per HIT that amounts to like ~$12-15/h approximately (goal is to be above minimum wage)

#### Launching the task and finding good workers
1. Run a <emm>pilot task</emm> on a small amount of examples (between 100-500), with a slightly higher number of workers/HIT than what your final task will be, to ensure wide participation.
   - For <emm>categorical</emm> tasks: consider selecting the examples that you know the answer to, for easier grading of workers.
2. Assess the quality of each worker's responses:
   - For <emm>categorical</emm> tasks: you can set up an autograder based on the responses you expect (if you have your own answers).
   - For <emm>free-text</emm> tasks: download CSV of results and scan through HITs, <emm>sorted by workerID</emm>.
3. While scanning, make two lists of workerIDs
   - List of <emm class="good">good workers</emm>.
   - List of <emm class="bad">bad workers</emm>.
4. Create two MTurk qualifications on Mturk:
   - For <emm class="good">good workers</emm>: call it "GreatAtMyTask"
   - For <emm class="bad">bad workers</emm>: call it "PreviouslyDoneMyTask"; the idea is that we can avoid upsetting workers by avoiding saying that they're bad at something.
5. Assign <emm class="bad">bad workers</emm> to bad qual and <emm class="good">good workers</emm> to good qual.
6. Create a copy of your pilot task
   - Set the requisites to be GoodAtMyTask (and other quals)
   - Reduce the number of workers/HIT to what you intended originally
7. If needed, re-run small "qualification" batch and do 1-6 again.  
Make sure to disallow good and bad workers from doing this qualification task.

### Background
I compiled this high-level recipe based on valuable advice I got from my current and former labmates who Turk (including [Emily Allaway](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/people/e/emily-allaway/), [Hannah Rashkin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hrashkin/)) and my own experience Turking (specifically, on the [ATOMIC](https://mosaickg.apps.allenai.org/kg_atomic), [SocialIQa](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/socialiqa/submissions/get-started), and [Social Bias Frames](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/social-bias-frames/) projects)
